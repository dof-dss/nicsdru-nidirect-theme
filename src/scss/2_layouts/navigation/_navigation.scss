// The layout styling for major parts of the page that are included with the
// theme. For layout we use cssgrid with appropriate fallback's. Given the simplistic nature of the site,
// only a couple of different grid layouts are ever needed and these can be re-used for different layout scenarios.
// - There two main 2 column layouts adopted in the site:
//   - a 2 column layout where each column is an equal width
//   - a 2 column layout where the one column is approximately 3x the width of the other, ie is in a ratio 3:1
// - There is one 3 column layout where each column is an equal width
// A grid container / row is initiated with the `.gd-row` class. The same page element should then have a second class
// which describes the desired composition of the layout. This will always take the form of
// `.gd-comp-X-cols` where X is the number of cols required. This can then by followed by an optional modifier which
// defines the ratio of the cols eg. `--ratio-eq`.
// Grid can be nested. More information is provided in the documentation for each layout.
